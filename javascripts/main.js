/*
Problem we're interested in: A Community of some number C of people wants to use a pool of cars of size X for typical usage patterns.
Each car has a cost-per-mile
Each car has a finite-but-unknown lifespan before it needs replacement.
Members of the community make plans for outings of various lengths, 
  and have different tolerances for scheduling: whenever, scheduled, emergency.
Failure to deliver on emergencies should be considered a critical failure of the system.
Failure to deliver on scheduled should be considered a lesser failure, and should be measured and reported in mean-minutes-late.

How to model this?
