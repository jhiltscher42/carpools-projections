Inspired by recent talks of pools of automated cars, I wanted to try to model the behavior of the system.  How big would the pool need to be to service a community with no late schedules?  How much would it cost to run and maintain?  It sounds a bit like the Elevator Problem; I want to see how efficient I can make it.
